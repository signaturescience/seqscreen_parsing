## reu2020_microbes

This repository contains a series of scripts for extracting data from the seqscreen output.
All files generated by this tool can be found in `outputs/` directory.

## BPoC Report

Taking in a .tsv file of SeqScreen output, creates:
- a revised.tsv file with only rows that have at least BPoC identified
- a summary.txt file with counts of BPoCs, percentages, and breakdowns of each BPoC
- a Krona Plot for the rows with BPoCs


```bash
python bpoc_parse.py <path_to_seqscreen_output>
```

**example:**
```bash
python bpoc_parse.py examples/SRR10903401_seqscreen_report.tsv
```

## GO Term Queries

Taking in a .tsv file of SeqScreen output and a list of GO terms, creates
these files for each GO term:
- a revised.tsv file with only rows that have that GO term
- a summary.txt file for that GO term
- a Krona Plot for that GO term

```bash
python go_term_parse.py <path_to_seqscreen_output> <go terms separated by spaces>
```
**optional flags:**

  * None

**example:**
```bash
python taxid_parse.py examples/SRR10903401_seqscreen_report.tsv 0016310 0016032 0003824
```
