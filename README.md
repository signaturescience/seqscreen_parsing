## reu2020_microbes

This repository contains a series of scripts for extracting data from the seqscreen output.
All files generated by this tool can be found in `outputs/` directory.

## Installation and Dependencies

Users must install [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/), 
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html), 
and [krona](https://github.com/marbl/Krona/wiki/Installing).

1. Install Miniconda based on your operating system using the link above.
Check that conda is installed in your `.bashrc` file by doing `cat .bashrc`, 
and make sure it's in the correct directory. Then run `source .bashrc`.
2. Install pandas using the link above.
3. Conda must be installed before installing krona.
To install krona without downloading the package manually, run `conda install -c bioconda krona`.
Then run `./updateTaxonomy.sh`.

Now you should be good to go!


## BPoC Report

Taking in a .tsv file of SeqScreen output, creates:
- a revised.tsv file with only rows that have at least BPoC identified
- a summary.txt file with counts of BPoCs, percentages, and breakdowns of each BPoC
- a Krona Plot for the rows with BPoCs


```bash
python bpoc_parse.py <path_to_seqscreen_output>
```

**example:**
```bash
python bpoc_parse.py examples/SRR10903401_seqscreen_report.tsv
```

## GO Term Queries

Taking in a .tsv file of SeqScreen output and a list of GO terms, creates
these files for each GO term:
- a revised.tsv file with only rows that have that GO term
- a summary.txt file for that GO term
- a Krona Plot for that GO term

```bash
python go_term_parse.py <path_to_seqscreen_output> <go terms separated by spaces>
```

**example:**
```bash
python go_term_parse.py examples/SRR10903401_seqscreen_report.tsv 0016310 0016032 0003824
python go_term_parse.py examples/SRR10903401_seqscreen_report.tsv GO:0016310 GO:0016032 
```
